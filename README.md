# Restaurant Order Analysis in SQL

### Project Overview
---

This project analyzes customer ordering behavior at Taste of the World Café, a restaurant known for its diverse menu and generous portions.

At the beginning of the year, the restaurant introduced a new menu, and as a newly hired Data Analyst, the goal of this project is to explore customer transaction data to understand which menu items are performing well, which are underperforming, and what customer preferences reveal about spending behavior.
The analysis focuses on exploring the menu, examining order patterns, and combining both datasets to uncover actionable business insights.
